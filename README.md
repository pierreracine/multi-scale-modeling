# multi-scale-modeling
Script for the modeling of the COVID 19 epidemic in France.
You will find a completed set of scripts to use a basic compartimental modele and optimize its parameters : "modele_presympto.py",
"optimization_beta", "optimization_lockdown.py", "optimization_behaviour.py", "modele_presympto_vac.py".

You will find some unfinished scripts for compartimental model taking account of an age-structured population "modele_age.py",
and another one, using stochastic compartimental model with age-structured population, "random.py".
